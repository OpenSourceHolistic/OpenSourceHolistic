- 👀 I’m interested in everything health and holistic, including herbal medicines, homeopathics, balms and topicals, regenerative agriculture, Cannabis, and more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about my interests and building a Drupal distribution for breeders of plants to collaborate with test growers and share journals
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more things than I could possibly list here and building the knowledge bases I intend to store here
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm @OpenSourceHolistic on Gmail and will probably start a corresponding Instagram (where you can find me @growmoseeds)
- 😄 Pronouns: we/our/mycelium 😉
- ⚡ Fun fact: Offering free natural seeds to natural growers in my area and elsewhere (while supplies last and as available, by discretion. Conditions apply.
